# Socket-chat

ðŸš€ Project Adventure: Diving Back into C & Exploring the World of Socket Programming ðŸš€

Hello! This is one of my current side quests, embarked upon to brush up on my C programming skills after a prolonged hiatus, due to school and my internship, which have been focused more on C++ and Arduino C. Additionally, I've always found socket programming intriguing, yet it was a topic only briefly covered in school, leaving me with little hands-on experience. Hence, I decided that developing a socket-chat application would be an excellent way to refresh my C knowledge and delve into something relatively new.

The project began by following some tutorials on YouTube. However, as I progressed, it started evolving beyond its tutorial origins. I've incorporated hash maps to store user structures, aiming for the application to function like a conventional chat system. You can choose whom you want to message directly and, eventually, I plan to introduce a group chat feature. Currently, the program sends a message to all connected sockets indiscriminately.

I'm excited to see how this project develops and to share the journey of rediscovering C and unraveling the mysteries of socket programming.

Note: I'm currently working on this project and it is not finished. So if my description doesn't match what you see in the repo. Then I still haven't updated this README.

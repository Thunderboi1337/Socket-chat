# Socket-chat

A project I'm currently working for fun on the side of my current internship and school. In doing this project I hope to refresh my skills in C a little, been doing alot of C++ and arduino coding for other projects and felt a little out of touch with C. This is also to introduce myself more to socket programming. Something I have only briefly touched on before in school.
